1.  Introduction

   Authorization is the process for granting approval to an entity to
   access a resource [RFC4949].  Managing authorization information for
   a large number of devices and users is often a complex task where
   dedicated servers are used.

   Managing authorization of users, services and their devices with the
   help of dedicated authorization servers (AS) is a common task, found
   in enterprise networks as well as on the Web.  In its simplest form
   the authorization task can be described as granting access to a
   requesting client, for a resource hosted on a device, the resource
   server (RS).  This exchange is mediated by one or multiple
   authorization servers.

   We envision that end consumers and enterprises will want to manage
   access-control and authorization for their Internet of Things (IoT)
   devices in the same style and this desire will increase with the
   number of exposed services and capabilities provided by applications
   hosted on the IoT devices.  The IoT devices may be constrained in
   various ways including processing, memory, code-size, energy, etc.,
   as defined in [RFC7228], and the different IoT deployments present a
   continuous range of device and network capabilities.  Taking energy
   consumption as an example: At one end there are energy-harvesting or
   battery powered devices which have a tight power budget, on the other
   end there are devices connected to a continuous power supply which
   are not constrained in terms of power, and all levels in between.
   Thus IoT devices are very different in terms of available processing
   and message exchange capabilities.

   This memo describes how to re-use OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] to extend
   authorization to Internet of Things devices with different kinds of
   constraints.  At the time of writing, OAuth 2.0 is already used with
   certain types of IoT devices and this document will provide
   implementers additional guidance for using it in a secure and
   privacy-friendly way.  Where possible the basic OAuth 2.0 mechanisms
   are used; in some circumstances profiles are defined, for example to
   support smaller the over-the-wire message size and smaller code size.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


   Certain security-related terms such as "authentication",
   "authorization", "confidentiality", "(data) integrity", "message
   authentication code", and "verify" are taken from [RFC4949].

   Since we describe exchanges as RESTful protocol interactions HTTP
   [RFC7231] offers useful terminology.

   Terminology for entities in the architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] and [I-D.ietf-ace-actors], such as client (C), resource
   server (RS), and authorization server (AS).  OAuth 2.0 uses the term
   "endpoint" to denote HTTP resources such as /token and /authorize at
   the AS, but we will use the term "resource" in this memo to avoid
   confusion with the CoAP [RFC7252] term "endpoint".

   Since this draft focuses on the problem of access control to
   resources, we simplify the actors by assuming that the client
   authorization server (CAS) functionality is not stand-alone but
   subsumed by either the authorization server or the client (see
   section 2.2 in [I-D.ietf-ace-actors]).

3.  Overview

   This specification describes a framework for authorization in the
   Internet of Things consisting of a set of building blocks.

   The basic block is the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] framework, which enjoys
   widespread deployment.  Many IoT devices can support OAuth 2.0
   without any additional extensions, but for certain constrained
   settings additional profiling is needed.

   Another building block is the lightweight web transfer protocol CoAP
   [RFC7252] for those communication environments where HTTP is not
   appropriate.  CoAP typically runs on top of UDP which further reduces
   overhead and message exchanges.  Transport layer security can be
   provided either by DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] or TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].

   A third building block is CBOR [RFC7049] for encodings where JSON
   [RFC7159] is not sufficiently compact.  CBOR is a binary encoding
   designed for extremely small code size and fairly small message size.
   OAuth 2.0 allows access tokens to use different encodings and this
   document defines such an alternative encoding.  The COSE message
   format [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] is also based on CBOR.

   A fourth building block is application layer security, which is used
   where transport layer security is insufficient.  At the time of
   writing the preferred approach for securing CoAP at the application
   layer is via the use of COSE [I-D.ietf-cose-msg], which adds object

   security to CBOR-encoded data.  More details about applying COSE to
   CoAP can be found in OSCOAP [I-D.selander-ace-object-security].

   With the building blocks listed above, solutions satisfying various
   IoT device and network constraints are possible.  A list of
   constraints is described in detail in RFC 7228 [RFC7228] and a
   description of how the building blocks mentioned above relate to the
   various constraints can be found in Appendix A.

   Luckily, not every IoT device suffers from all constraints.  The
   described framework nevertheless takes all these aspects into account
   and allows several different deployment variants to co-exist rather
   than mandating a one-size-fits-all solution.  We believe this is
   important to cover the wide range of possible interworking use cases
   and the different requirements from a security point of view.  Once
   IoT deployments mature, popular deployment variants will be
   documented in form of profiles.

   In the subsections below we provide further details about the
   different building blocks.

3.1.  OAuth 2.0

   The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a client to obtain
   limited access to a resource with the permission of a resource owner.
   Authorization related information is passed between the nodes using
   access tokens.  These access tokens are issued to clients by an
   authorization server with the approval of the resource owner.  The
   client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted
   by the resource server.

   A number of OAuth 2.0 terms are used within this memo:

   Access Tokens:

      Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.
      An access token is a data structure representing authorization
      permissions issued to the client.  Access tokens are generated by
      the authorization server and consumed by the resource server.  The
      access token is opaque to the client.

      Access tokens can have different formats, and various methods of
      utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the security
      requirements of the given deployment.

   Proof of Possession Tokens:





Seitz, et al.            Expires August 4, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


      An access token may be bound to a cryptographic key, which is then
      used by an RS to authenticate requests from a client.  Such tokens
      are called proof-of-possession tokens (or PoP tokens)
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-architecture].

      The proof-of-possession (PoP) security concept assumes that the AS
      acts as a trusted third party that binds keys to access tokens.
      These so called PoP keys are then used by the client to
      demonstrate the possession of the secret to the RS when accessing
      the resource.  The RS, when receiving an access token, needs to
      verify that the key used by the client matches the one included in
      the access token.  When this memo uses the term "access token" it
      is assumed to be a PoP token unless specifically stated otherwise.

      The key bound to the access token (aka PoP key) may be based on
      symmetric as well as on asymmetric cryptography.  The appropriate
      choice of security depends on the constraints of the IoT devices
      as well as on the security requirements of the use case.

      Symmetric PoP key:

         The AS generates a random symmetric PoP key, encrypts it for
         the RS and includes it inside an access token.  The PoP key is
         also encrypted for the client and sent together with the access
         token to the client.

      Asymmetric PoP key:

         An asymmetric key pair is generated on the client and the
         public key is sent to the AS (if it does not already have
         knowledge of the client's public key).  Information about the
         public key, which is the PoP key in this case, is then included
         inside the access token and sent back to the requesting client.
         The RS can identify the client's public key from the
         information in the token, which allows the client to use the
         corresponding private key for the proof of possession.

      The access token is protected against modifications using a MAC or
      a digital signature of the AS.  The choice of PoP key does not
      necessarily imply a specific credential type for the integrity
      protection of the token.  More information about PoP tokens can be
      found in [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-architecture].

   Scopes and Permissions:

      In OAuth 2.0, the client specifies the type of permissions it is
      seeking to obtain (via the scope parameter) in the access request.
      In turn, the AS may use the "scope" response parameter to inform

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


      the client of the scope of the access token issued.  As the client
      could be a constrained device as well, this memo uses CBOR encoded
      messages defined in Appendix D to request scopes and to be
      informed what scopes the access token was actually authorized for
      by the AS.

      The values of the scope parameter are expressed as a list of
      space- delimited, case-sensitive strings, with a semantic that is
      well-known to the AS and the RS.  More details about the concept
      of scopes is found under Section 3.3 in [RFC6749].

   Claims:

      The information carried in the access token in the form of type-
      value pairs is called claims.  An access token may for example
      include a claim about the AS that issued the token (the "iss"
      claim) and what audience the access token is intended for (the
      "aud" claim).  The audience of an access token can be a specific
      resource or one or many resource servers.  The resource owner
      policies influence the what claims are put into the access token
      by the authorization server.

      While the structure and encoding of the access token varies
      throughout deployments, a standardized format has been defined
      with the JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] where claims are encoded
      as a JSON object.  In [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token] an
      equivalent format using CBOR encoding (CWT) has been defined.

   Introspection:

      Introspection is a method for a resource server to query the
      authorization server for the active state and content of a
      received access token.  This is particularly useful in those cases
      where the authorization decisions are very dynamic and/or where
      the received access token itself is a reference rather than a
      self-contained token.  More information about introspection in
      OAuth 2.0 can be found in [I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection].

3.2.  CoAP

   CoAP is an application layer protocol similar to HTTP, but
   specifically designed for constrained environments.  CoAP typically
   uses datagram-oriented transport, such as UDP, where reordering and
   loss of packets can occur.  A security solution need to take the
   latter aspects into account.






Seitz, et al.            Expires August 4, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


   While HTTP uses headers and query-strings to convey additional
   information about a request, CoAP encodes such information in so-
   called 'options'.

   CoAP supports application-layer fragmentation of the CoAP payloads
   through blockwise transfers [I-D.ietf-core-block].  However, this
   method does not allow the fragmentation of large CoAP options,
   therefore data encoded in options has to be kept small.

3.3.  Object Security

   Transport layer security is not always sufficient and application
   layer security has to be provided.  COSE [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] defines
   a message format for cryptographic protection of data using CBOR
   encoding.  There are two main approaches for application layer
   security:

   Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP)

      OSCOAP [I-D.selander-ace-object-security] is a method for
      protecting CoAP request/response message exchanges, including CoAP
      payloads, CoAP header fields as well as CoAP options.  OSCOAP
      provides end-to-end confidentiality, integrity and replay
      protection, and a secure binding between CoAP request and response
      messages.

      A CoAP message protected with OSCOAP contains the CoAP option
      "Object-Security" which signals that the CoAP message carries a
      COSE message ([I-D.ietf-cose-msg]).  OSCOAP defines a profile of
      COSE which includes replay protection.

   Object Security of Content (OSCON)

      For the case of wrapping of application layer payload data
      ("content") only, such as resource representations or claims of
      access tokens, the same COSE profile can be applied to obtain end-
      to-end confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.
      [I-D.selander-ace-object-security] defines this functionality as
      Object Security of Content (OSCON).

      In this case, the message is not bound to the underlying
      application layer protocol and can therefore be used with HTTP,
      CoAP, Bluetooth Smart, etc.  While OSCOAP integrity protects
      specific CoAP message meta-data like request/response code, and
      binds a response to a specific request, OSCON protects only
      payload/content, therefore those security features are lost.  The
      advantages are that an OSCON message can be passed across

      different protocols, from request to response, and used to secure
      group communications.

4.  Protocol Interactions

   This framework is based on the same protocol interactions as OAuth
   2.0: A client obtains an access token from an AS and presents the
   token to an RS to gain access to a protected resource.  These
   interactions are shown in Figure 1.  An overview of various OAuth
   concepts is provided in Section 3.1.

   The consent of the resource owner, for giving a client access to a
   protected resource, can be pre-configured authorization policies or
   dynamically at the time when the request is sent.  The resource owner
   and the requesting party (= client owner) are not shown in Figure 1.

   For the description in this document we assume that the client has
   been registered to an AS.  Registration means that the two share
   credentials, configuration parameters and that some form of
   authorization has taken place.  These credentials are used to protect
   the token request by the client and the transport of access tokens
   and client information from AS to the client.

   It is also assumed that the RS has been registered with the AS.
   Established keying material between the AS and the RS allows the AS
   to apply cryptographic protection to the access token to ensure that
   the content cannot be modified, and if needed, that the content is
   confidentiality protected.

   The keying material necessary for establishing communication security
   between C and RS is dynamically established as part of the protocol
   described in this document.

   At the start of the protocol there is an optional discovery step
   where the client discovers the resource server and the resources this
   server hosts.  In this step the client might also determine what
   permissions are needed to access the protected resource.  The exact
   procedure depends on the protocols being used and the specific
   deployment environment.  In Bluetooth Smart, for example,
   advertisements are broadcasted by a peripheral, including information
   about the supported services.  In CoAP, as a second example, a client
   can makes a request to "/.well-known/core" to obtain information
   about available resources, which are returned in a standardized
   format as described in [RFC6690].

               Figure 1: Overview of the basic protocol flow

   Requesting an Access Token (A):

      The client makes an access token request to the AS.  This memo
      assumes the use of PoP tokens (see Section 3.1 for a short
      description) wherein the AS binds a key to an access token.  The
      client may include permissions it seeks to obtain, and information
      about the type of credentials it wants to use (i.e., symmetric or
      asymmetric cryptography).

   Access Token Response (B):

      If the AS successfully processes the request from the client, it
      returns an access token.  It also includes various parameters,
      which we call "Client Information".  In addition to the response
      parameters defined by OAuth 2.0 and the PoP token extension, we
      consider new kinds of response parameters in Section 5, including
      information on which security protocol the client should use with
      the resource server(s) that it has just been authorized to access.
      Communication security between client and RS may be based on pre-
      provisioned keys/security contexts or dynamically established.
      The RS authenticates the client via the PoP token; and the client
      authenticates the RS via the client information as described in
      Section 5.1.

   Resource Request (C):

      The client interacts with the RS to request access to the
      protected resource and provides the access token.  The protocol to
      use between the client and the RS is not restricted to CoAP; HTTP,
      HTTP/2, Bluetooth Smart etc., are also possible candidates.

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


      Depending on the device limitations and the selected protocol this
      exchange may be split up into two phases:

         (1) the client sends the access token to a newly defined
         authorization endpoint at the RS (see Section 5.3) , which
         conveys authorization information to the RS that may be used by
         the client for subsequent resource requests, and

         (2) the client makes the resource access request, using the
         communication security protocol and other client information
         obtained from the AS.

      The RS verifies that the token is integrity protected by the AS
      and compares the claims contained in the access token with the
      resource request.  If the RS is online, validation can be handed
      over to the AS using token introspection (see messages D and E)
      over HTTP or CoAP, in which case the different parts of step C may
      be interleaved with introspection.

   Token Introspection Request (D):

      A resource server may be configured to use token introspection to
      interact with the AS to obtain the most recent claims, such as
      scope, audience, validity etc.  associated with a specific access
      token.  Token introspection over CoAP is defined in
      [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-oauth-introspection] and for HTTP in
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection].

      Note that token introspection is an optional step and can be
      omitted if the token is self-contained and the resource server is
      prepared to perform the token validation on its own.

   Token Introspection Response (E):

      The AS validates the token and returns the claims associated with
      it back to the RS.  The RS then uses the received claims to
      process the request to either accept or to deny it.

   Protected Resource (F):

      If the request from the client is authorized, the RS fulfills the
      request and returns a response with the appropriate response code.
      The RS uses the dynamically established keys to protect the
      response, according to used communication security protocol.

5.  OAuth 2.0 Profiling

   This section describes profiles of OAuth 2.0 adjusting it to
   constrained environments for use cases where this is necessary.
   Profiling for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is provided in
   [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

5.1.  Communication Security Protocol

   OAuth 2.0 using bearer tokens, as described in [RFC6749] and in
   [RFC6750], requires TLS for all communication interactions between
   client, authorization server, and resource server.  This is possible
   in the scope where OAuth 2.0 was originally developed: web and mobile
   applications.  In these environments resources like computational
   power and bandwidth are not scarce and operating systems as well as
   browser platforms are pre-provisioned with trust anchors that enable
   clients to authenticate servers based on the Web PKI.  In a more
   heterogeneous IoT environment a wider range of use cases needs to be
   supported.  Therefore, this document suggests extensions to OAuth 2.0
   that enables the AS to inform the client on how to communicate
   securely with a RS and that allows the client to indicate
   communication security preferences to the AS.

   The client may be a constrained device and could therefore be limited
   in the communication security protocols it supports.  It can
   therefore signal to the AS which protocols it can support for
   securing their mutual communication.  This is done by using the "csp"
   parameter in the Token Request message to the AS.

   The client and the RS might not have any prior knowledge about each
   other, therefore the AS needs to help them to establish a security
   context or at least a key.  The AS does this by indicating
   communication security protocol ("csp") and additional key parameters
   in the client information.

   The "csp" parameter specifies how client and RS communication is
   going to be secured based on returned keys.  Currently defined values
   are "TLS", "DTLS", "OSCOAP" and "OSCON" with the encodings specified
   in Figure 2.  Depending on the value different additional parameters
   become mandatory (FIXME: Define which).

                               Information.

   CoAP specifies three security modes of DTLS: PreSharedKey,
   RawPublicKey and Certificate.  For Certificate mode, additional
   information MAY be provided in the same way as for TLS.

   For PreSharedKey mode, the AS MUST provide the client with the
   corresponding key used by the RS.  If PoP tokens with symmetric keys
   are used (see section 4 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution]),
   the client MUST use the PoP key as DTLS pre-shared key.  If PoP
   tokens are not used or if the PoP token is based on an asymmetric
   key, the AS MUST provide the client with the DTLS pre-shared key in
   the client information, using the "psk" parameter defined below.

   If the RS uses RawPublicKey mode, the RS' key SHOULD be provided to
   the client in the Client Information using the "rpk" parameter
   defined below.  If PoP tokens with asymmetric keys are used (see
   section 5 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution]) , the client MUST
   use the PoP key for client authentication in DTLS.

   TLS or DTLS with certificates MAY make use of pre-established trust
   anchors or MAY be configured more tightly with additional client
   information parameters, such as x5c, x5t, or x5t#S256.  An overview
   of these parameters is given below.

   To use object security (such as OSCOAP and OSCON) requires security
   context to be established, which can be provisioned with PoP token
   and client information, or derived from that information.  This memo
   defines a generic container object that is supposed to function as
   the root element providing this security context information.  Object
   security specifications designed to be used with this protocol MUST
   specify the content format and correspondings processing rules.

   When using DTLS, OSCOAP or OSCON the communication security may be
   based on raw public keys.  This attribute is a JWK/CWK representation
   of the public key that the RS will use to protect communication.  The
   alg parameter of the JWK/CWK is used to indicate how the key should
   be used.

   For when communication security is based on certificates this
   attribute can be used to define the server certificate or CA
   certificate.  Semantics for this attribute is defined by [RFC7517] or
   CWK (FIXME, future reference).

   For when communication security is based on certificates this
   attribute can be used to define the specific server certificate to
   expect or the CA certificate.  Semantics for this attribute is
   defined by JWK/CWK.

5.2.  CoAP Access-Token Option

   OAuth 2.0 access tokens are usually transferred as authorisation
   header.  CoAP has no authorisation header equivalence.  This document
   therefor register the option Access-Token.  The Access-Token option
   is an alternative for transferring the access token when it is
   smaller then 255 bytes.  If token is larger the 255 bytes lager
   authorisation information resources MUST at the RS be user when CoAP.

5.3.  Authorization Information Resource at the Resource Server

   A consequence of allowing the use of CoAP as web transfer protocol is
   that we cannot rely on HTTP specific mechanisms, such as transferring
   information elements in HTTP headers since those are not necessarily
   gracefully mapped to CoAP.  In case the access token is larger than
   255 bytes it should not be sent as a CoAP option.

   For conveying authorization information to the RS we therefore
   introduce a new resource to which the PoP tokens can be sent to
   convey authorization information before the first resource request is
   made by the client.  This specification calls this resource "/authz-
   info"; the URI may, however, vary in deployments.

   The RS needs to store the PoP token for when later authorising
   requests from the client.  The RS is not mandated to be able to
   manage multiple client at once. how the RS manages clients is out of
   scope for this specification.

5.3.1.  Authorization Information Request

   The client makes a POST request to the authorisation information
   resource by sending its PoP token as request data.

   Client MUST send the Content-Format option indicate token format

5.3.2.  Authorization Information Response

   The RS may select to not respond to save resources, no response may
   indicate success or error the client can only know by doing an access
   request after having passed the token.  If it responds it MUST
   respond according to success or error response section

5.3.2.1.  Success Response

   Successful responses SHOULD respond with 2.01 Created to indicate
   that a "session" for the PoP Token has been created.  No location
   path is required to be returned.

5.4.  Authorization Information Format

   We introduce a new claim for describing access rights with a specific
   format, the "aif" claim.  In this memo we propose to use the compact
   format provided by AIF [I-D.bormann-core-ace-aif].  Access rights may
   be specified as a list of URIs of resources together with allowed
   actions (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE).  Other formats may be
   mandated by specific applications or requirements (e.g. specifying
   local conditions on access).

5.5.  CBOR Data Formats

   The /token resource (called "endpoint" in OAuth 2.0), defined in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC6749], is used by the client to obtain an access
   token.  Requests sent to the /token resource use the HTTP POST method
   and the payload includes a query component, which is formatted as
   application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  CoAP payloads cannot be formatted
   in the same way which requires the /token resource on the AS to be
   profiled.  Appendix D defines a CBOR-based format for sending
   parameters to the /token resource.

6.  Deployment Scenarios

   There is a large variety of IoT deployments, as is indicated in
   Appendix A, and this section highlights common variants.  This
   section is not normative but illustrates how the framework can be
   applied.

   For each of the deployment variants there are a number of possible
   security setups between clients, resource servers and authorization
   servers.  The main focus in the following subsections is on how
   authorization of a client request for a resource hosted by a RS is

   performed.  This requires us to also consider how these requests and
   responses between the clients and the resource servers are secured.

   The security protocols between other pairs of nodes in the
   architecture, namely client-to-AS and RS-to-AS, are not detailed in
   these examples.  Different security protocols may be used on
   transport or application layer.

   Note: We use the CBOR diagnostic notation for examples of requests
   and responses.

6.1.  Client and Resource Server are Offline

   In this scenario we consider the case where both the resource server
   and the client are offline, i.e., they are not connected to the AS at
   the time of the resource request.  This access procedure involves
   steps A, B, C, and F of Figure 1, but assumes that step A and B have
   been carried out during a phase when the client had connectivity to
   AS.

   Since the resource server must be able to verify the access token
   locally, self-contained access tokens must be used.

   This example shows the interactions between a client, the
   authorization server and a temperature sensor acting as a resource
   server.  Message exchanges A and B are shown in Figure 5.

      A: The client first generates a public-private key pair used for
      communication security with the RS.

      The client sends the POST request to /token at AS.  The request
      contains the public key of the client and the Audience parameter
      set to "tempSensorInLivingRoom", a value that the temperature
      sensor identifies itself with.  The AS evaluates the request and
      authorizes the client to access the resource.

      B: The AS responds with a PoP token and client information.  The
      PoP token contains the public key of the client, while the client
      information contains the public key of the RS.  For communication
      security this example uses DTLS with raw public keys between the
      client and the RS.

      Note: In this example we assume that the client knows what
      resource it wants to access, and is therefore able to request
      specific audience and scope claims for the access token.

      C: The client then sends the PoP token to the /authz-info resource

      between client and RS, since the token is integrity protected
      between AS and RS.  The RS verifies that the PoP token was created
      by a known and trusted AS, is valid, and responds to the client.
      The RS caches the security context together with authorization
      information about this client contained in the PoP token.

      The client and resource server run the DTLS handshake using the

6.2.  Resource Server Offline

   In this deployment scenario we consider the case of an RS that may
   not be able to access the AS at the time it receives an access
   request from a client.  We denote this case "RS offline", it involves
   steps A, B, C and F of Figure 1.

   If the RS is offline, then it must be possible for the RS to locally
   validate the access token.  This requires self-contained tokens to be
   used.

   The validity time for the token should always be chosen as short as
   possible to reduce the possibility that a token contains out-of-date
   authorization information.  Therefore the value for the Expiration
   Time claim ("exp") should be set only slightly larger than the value
   for the Issuing Time claim ("iss").  A constrained RS with means to
   reliably measure time must validate the expiration time of the access
   token.

   The following example shows interactions between a client (air-
   conditioning control unit), an offline resource server (temperature
   sensor)and an authorization server.  The message exchanges A and B
   are shown in Figure 11.

      A: The client sends the request POST to /token at AS.  The request
      contains the Audience parameter set to "tempSensor109797", a value
      that the temperature sensor identifies itself with.  The scope the
      client want's the AS to authorize the access token for is "owner",
      which means that the token can be used to both read temperature

      data and upgrade the firmware on the RS.  The AS evaluates the
      request and authorizes the client to access the resource.

      B: The AS responds with a PoP token and client information.  The
      PoP token is wrapped in a COSE message, object secured content
      from AS to RS.  The client information contains a symmetric key.
      In this case communication security between C and RS is OSCOAP
      with an authenticated encryption algorithm.  The client derives
      two unidirectional security contexts to use with the resource
      request and response messages.  The access token includes the
      claim "aif" with the authorized access that an owner of the
      temperature device can enjoy.  The "aif" claim, issued by the AS,
      informs the RS that the owner of the access token, that can prove
      the possession of a key is authorized to make a GET request
      against the /tempC resource and a POST request on the /firmware
      resource.

   Message exchanges C and F are shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

      C: The client then sends the PoP token to the /authz-info resource
      in the RS.  This is a plain CoAP request, i.e. no DTLS/OSCOAP
      between client and RS, since the token is integrity protected
      between AS and RS.  The RS verifies that the PoP token was created

      by a known and trusted AS, is valid, and responds to the client.
      The RS derives and caches the security contexts together with
      authorization information about this client contained in the PoP
      token.

      The client sends the CoAP requests GET to /tempC on the RS using
      OSCOAP.  The RS verifies the request and that it is authorized.

      F: The RS responds with a protected status code using OSCOAP.  The
      client verifies the response.

   an indication of the content of the COSE object: a sequence number
   ("seq", starting from 0), a context identifier ("cid") indicating the
   security context, the ciphertext containing the encrypted CoAP option
   identifying the resource, and the Message Authentication Code ("tag")
   which also covers the Code in the CoAP header.

   The Object-Security ciphertext in the response [22.7 C] represents an
   encrypted temperature reading.  (The COSE object is actually carried
   in the CoAP payload when possible but that is omitted to simplify
   notation.)

6.3.  Token Introspection with an Offline Client

   In this deployment scenario we assume that a client is not be able to
   access the AS at the time of the access request.  Since the RS is,
   however, connected to the back-end infrastructure it can make use of
   token introspection.  This access procedure involves steps A-F of
   Figure 1, but assumes steps A and B have been carried out during a
   phase when the client had connectivity to AS.

   Since the client is assumed to be offline, at least for a certain
   period of time, a pre-provisioned access token has to be long-lived.
   The resource server may use its online connectivity to validate the
   access token with the authorization server, which is shown in the
   example below.

   In the example we show the interactions between an offline client
   (key fob), a resource server (online lock), and an authorization
   server.  We assume that there is a provisioning step where the client
   has access to the AS.  This corresponds to message exchanges A and B
   which are shown in Figure 16.

      A: The client sends the request using POST to /token at AS.  The
      request contains the Audience parameter set to "lockOfDoor4711", a
      value the that the online door in question identifies itself with.
      The AS generates an access token as on opaque string, which it can
      match to the specific client, a targeted audience and a symmetric
      key security context.

      B: The AS responds with the an access token and client
      information, the latter containing a symmetric key.  Communication
      security between C and RS will be OSCOAP with authenticated
      encryption.

      Figure 16: Token Request and Response using Client Credentials.

   Authorization consent from the resource owner can be pre-configured,
   but it can also be provided via an interactive flow with the resource
   owner.  An example of this for the key fob case could be that the
   resource owner has a connected car, he buys a generic key that he
   wants to use with the car.  To authorize the key fob he connects it
   to his computer that then provides the UI for the device.  After that
   OAuth 2.0 implicit flow is used to authorize the key for his car at
   the the car manufacturers AS.

   The information contained in the Request-Payload and the Response-
   Payload is shown in Figure 17.

   Request-Payload:

   }

   The access token in this case is just an opaque string referencing
   the authorization information at the AS.

      C: Next, the client POSTs the access token to the /authz-info
      resource in the RS.  This is a plain CoAP request, i.e. no DTLS/
      OSCOAP between client and RS.  Since the token is an opaque
      string, the RS cannot verify it on its own, and thus defers to
      respond the client with a status code until step E and only
      acknowledges on the CoAP message layer (indicated with a dashed
      line).

      D: The RS forwards the token to the /introspect resource on the
      AS.  Introspection assumes a secure connection between the AS and
      the RS, e.g. using DTLS or OSCOAP, which is not detailed in this
      example.

      E: The AS provides the introspection response containing claims
      about the token.  This includes the confirmation key (cnf) claim
      that allows the RS to verify the client's proof of possession in
      step F.

      After receiving message E, the RS responds to the client's POST in

   The Object-Security ciphertext [...] of the PUT request contains CoAP
   options that are encrypted, as well as the payload value '1' which is
   the value of PUT to the door lock.

   In this example there is no ciphertext of the PUT response, but "tag"
   contains a MAC which covers the request sequence number and context
   identifier as well as the Code which allows the Client to verify that
   this actuator command was well received (door is locked).

6.4.  Always-On Connectivity

   A popular deployment scenario for IoT devices is to have them always
   be connected to the Internet so that they can be reachable to receive
   commands.  As a continuation from the previous scenarios we assume
   that both the client and the RS are online at the time of the access
   request.

   If the client and the resource server are online then the AS should
   be configured to issue short-lived access tokens for the resource to
   the client.  The resource server must then validate self-contained
   access tokens or otherwise must use token introspection to obtain the
   up-to-date claim information.  If transmission costs are high or the
   channel is lossy, the CWT token format
   [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token] may be used instead of a JWT to
   reduce the volume of network traffic.  In terms of messaging this
   deployment scenario uses the patterns described in the previous sub-
   sections.

   Note that despite the lack of connectivity constraints there may
   still be other restrictions a deployment may face.

6.5.  Token-less Authorization

   In this deployment scenario we consider the case of an RS which is
   severely energy constrained, sleeps most of the time and need to have
   a tight messaging budget.  It is not only infeasible to access the AS
   at the time of the access request, as in the "RS offline" case
   Section 6.2, it must be offloaded as much message communication as
   possible.

   OAuth 2.0 is already an efficient protocol in terms of message
   exchanges and can be further optimized by compact encodings of
   tokens.  The scenario illustrated in this section goes beyond that
   and removes the access tokens from the protocol.  This may be
   considered a degenerate case of OAuth 2.0 but it allows us to do two
   things:

   1.  The common case where authorization is performed by means of
       authentication fits into the same protocol framework.
       Authentication protocol and key is specified by client
       information, and access token is omitted.

   2.  Authentication, and thereby authorization, may even be implicit,
       i.e. anyone with access to the right key is authorized to access
       the protected resource.

   In case 2., the RS does not need to receive any message from the
   client, and therefore enables offloading recurring resource request
   and response processing to a third party, such as a Message Broker
   (MB) in a publish-subscribe setting.

   This scenario involves steps A, B, C and F of Figure 1 and four
   parties: a client (subscriber), an offline RS (publisher), a trusted
   AS, and a MB, not necessarily trusted with access to the plain text
   publications.  Message exchange A, B is shown in Figure 22.

      A: The client sends the request POST to /token at AS.  The request
      contains the Audience parameter set to "birchPollenSensor301", a
      value that characterizes a certain pollen sensor resource.  The AS
      evaluates the request and authorizes the client to access the
      resource.

      B: The AS responds with an empty token and client information with
      a security context to be used by the client.  The empty token
      signifies that authorization is performed by means of
      authentication using the communication security protocol indicated
      with "csp".  In this case it is object security of content (OSCON)
      i.e. protection of CoAP payload only.  The security context

   The RS, which sleeps most of the time, occasionally wakes up,
   measures the number birch pollens per cubic meters, publishes the
   measurements to the MB, and then returns to sleep.  See Figure 25.

   In this case the birch pollen count stopped at 270, which is
   encrypted with the symmetric key and signed with the private key of
   the RS.  The MB verifies that the message originates from RS using
   the public key of RS, that it is not a replay of an old measurement
   using the sequence number of the OSCON COSE profile, and caches the
   object secured content.  The MB does not have the secret key so is
   unable to read the plain text measurement.

   Message exchanges C and F are shown in Figure 25.

      C: Since there is no access token, the client does not address the
      /authz-info resource in the RS.  The client sends the CoAP request
      GET to /birchPollen on MB which is a plain CoAP request.

      F: The MB responds with the cached object secured content.

              Figure 25: Sensor measurement protected by COSE

   The payload is a COSE message consisting of sequence number 'seq'
   stepped by the RS for each publication, the context identifier 'cid'
   in this case coinciding with the key identifier 'kid' of Figure 24,
   the encrypted measurement and the signature by the RS.

   Note that the same COSE message format may be used as in OSCOAP but
   that only CoAP payload is protected in this case.

   The authorization step is implicit, so while any client could request
   access the COSE object, only authorized clients have access to the
   symmetric key needed to decrypt the content.

   Note that in this case the order of the message exchanges A,B and C,F
   could in principle be interchanged, i.e. the client could first
   request and obtain the protected resource in steps C,F; and after
   that request client information containing the keys decrypt and
   verify the message.

6.6.  Securing Group Communication

   There are use cases that require securing communication between a
   (group of) senders and a group of receivers.  One prominent example
   is lighting.  Often, a set of lighting nodes (e.g., luminaires, wall-
   switches, sensors) are grouped together and only authorized members
   of the group must be able read and process messages.  Additionally,

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


   receivers of group messages must be able to verify the integrity of
   received messages as being generated within the group.

   The requirements for securely communicating in such group use cases
   efficiently is outlined in [I-D.somaraju-ace-multicast] along with an
   architectural description that aligns with the content of this
   document.  The requirements for conveying the necessary identifiers
   to reference groups and also the process of commissioning devices can
   be accomplished using the protocol described in this document.  For
   details about the lighting-unique use case aspects, the architecture,
   as well as other multicast-specific considerations we refer the
   reader to [I-D.somaraju-ace-multicast].

7.  Security Considerations

   The entire document is about security.  Security considerations
   applicable to authentication and authorization in RESTful
   environments provided in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] apply to this work, as
   well as the security considerations from [I-D.ietf-ace-actors].
   Furthermore [RFC6819] provides additional security considerations for
   OAuth which apply to IoT deployments as well.  Finally
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-architecture] discusses security and privacy
   threats as well as mitigation measures for Proof-of-Possession
   tokens.

Appendix A.  Design Justification

   This section provides further insight into the design decisions of
   the solution documented in this document.  Section 3 lists several
   building blocks and briefly summarizes their importance.  The
   justification for offering some of those building blocks, as opposed
   to using OAuth 2.0 as is, is given below.

   Common IoT constraints are:

   Low Power Radio:




Seitz, et al.            Expires August 4, 2016                [Page 37]

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


      Many IoT devices are equipped with a small battery which needs to
      last for a long time.  For many constrained wireless devices the
      highest energy cost is associated to transmitting or receiving
      messages.  It is therefore important to keep the total
      communication overhead low, including minimizing the number and
      size of messages sent and received, which has an impact of choice
      on the message format and protocol.  By using CoAP over UDP, and
      CBOR encoded messages some of these aspects are addressed.
      Security protocols contribute to the communication overhead and
      can in some cases be optimized.  For example authentication and
      key establishment may in certain cases where security requirements
      so allows be replaced by provisioning of security context by a
      trusted third party, using transport or application layer
      security.

   Low CPU Speed:

      Some IoT devices are equipped with processors that are
      significantly slower than those found in most current devices on
      the Internet.  This typically has implications on what timely
      cryptographic operations a device is capable to perform, which in
      turn impacts e.g. protocol latency.  Symmetric key cryptography
      may be used instead of the computationally more expensive public
      key cryptography where the security requirements so allows, but
      this may also require support for trusted third party assisted
      secret key establishment using transport or application layer
      security.

   Small Amount of Memory:

      Microcontrollers embedded in IoT devices are often equipped with
      small amount of RAM and flash memory, which places limitations
      what kind of processing can be performed and how much code can be
      put on those devices.  To reduce code size fewer and smaller
      protocol implementations can be put on the firmware of such a
      device.  In this case, CoAP may be used instead of HTTP, symmetric
      key cryptography instead of public key cryptography, and CBOR
      instead of JSON.  Authentication and key establishment protocol,
      e.g. the DTLS handshake, in comparison with assisted key
      establishment also has an impact on memory and code.

   User Interface Limitations:

      Protecting access to resources is both an important security as
      well as privacy feature.  End users and enterprise customers do
      not want to give access to the data collected by their IoT device
      or to functions it may offer to third parties.  Since the
      classical approach of requesting permissions from end users via a

Internet-Draft         OAuth 2.0 IoT Authorization         February 2016


      rich user interface does not work in many IoT deployment scenarios
      these functions need to be delegated to user controlled devices
      that are better suitable for such tasks, such as smart phones and
      tablets.

   Communication Constraints:

      In certain constrained settings an IoT device may not be able to
      communicate with a given device at all times.  Devices may be
      sleeping, or just disconnected from the Internet because of
      general lack of connectivity in the area, for cost reasons, or for
      security reasons, e.g. to avoid an entry point for Denial-of-
      Service attacks.

      The communication interactions this framework builds upon (as
      shown graphically in Figure 1) may be accomplished using a variety
      of different protocols, and not all parts of the message flow are
      used in all applications due to the communication constraints.
      While we envision deployments to make use of CoAP we explicitly
      want to support HTTP, HTTP/2 or specific protocols, such as
      Bluetooth Smart communication, which does not necessarily use IP.
      The latter raises the need for application layer security over the
      various interfaces.

Appendix C.  Optimizations

   This section sketches some potential optimizations to the presented
   solution.

   Access token in DTLS handshake

      In the case of CSP=DTLS/TLS, the access token provisoning exchange
      in step C of the protocol may be embedded in the security
      handshake.  Different solutions are possible, where one
      standardized method would be the use of the TLS supplemental data
      extension [RFC4680] for transferring the access token.

   Reference token and introspection

      In case of introspection it may be beneficial to utilize access
      tokens which are not self-contained (also known as "reference
      tokens") that are used to lookup detailed information about the
      authorization.  The RS uses the introspection message exchange not
      only for validating token claims, but also for obtaining claims
      that potentially were not known at the time when the access token
      was issued.

      A reference token can be made much more compact than a self-
      contained token, since it does not need to contain any of claims
      that it represents.  This could be very useful in particular if
      the client is constrained and offline most of the time.

   Reference token in CoAP option

      While large access tokens must be sent in CoAP payload, if the
      access token is known to be of a certain limited size, for example
      in the case of a reference token, then it would be favorable to
      combine the access token provisioning request with the resource
      request to the RS.

      One way to achieve this is to define a new CoAP option for
      carrying reference tokens, called "Ref-Token" as shown in the
      example in Figure 26.

Appendix D.  CoAP and CBOR profiles for OAuth 2.0

   Many IoT devices can support OAuth 2.0 without any additional
   extensions, but for certain constrained settings additional profiling
   is needed.  In this appendix we define CoAP resources for the HTTP
   based token and introspection endpoints used in vanilla OAuth 2.0.
   We also define a CBOR alternative to the JSON and form based POST
   structures used in HTTP.

D.1.  Profile for Token resource

   The token resource is used by the client to obtain an access token by
   presenting its authorization grant or client credentials to the
   /token resource the AS.

D.1.1.  Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token resource by sending a CBOR
   structure with the following attributes.

   grant_type:

      REQUIRED.  The grant type, "code", "client_credentials",
      "password" or others.

   client_id:

      OPTIONAL.  The client identifier issued to the holder of the token
      (client or RS) during the registration process.

      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the public key
      the client would like to bind to the access token in the COSE Key
      Structure format.

   The parameters defined above use the following CBOR major types.

        /-----------+--------------+-----------------------\
        | Value     | Major Type   | Key                   |

D.2.  CoAP Profile for OAuth Introspection

   This section defines a way for a holder of access tokens, mainly
   clients and RS's, to get metadata like validity status, claims and
   scopes found in access token.  The OAuth Token Introspection
   specification [I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection] defines a way to
   validate the token using HTTP POST or HTTP GET.  This document reuses
   the work done in the OAuth Token Introspection and defines a mapping
   of the request and response to CoAP [RFC7252] to be used by
   constrained devices.

D.2.1.  Introspection Request

   The token holder makes a request to the Introspection CoAP resource
   by sending a CBOR structure with the following attributes.

   token:

      REQUIRED.  The string value of the token.

   resource_id:

      OPTIONAL.  A service-specific string identifying the resource that
      the client doing the introspection is asking about.

   client_id:

      OPTIONAL.  The client identifier issued to the holder of the token
      (client or RS) during the registration process.

   client_secret:

      OPTIONAL.  The client secret.

   The parameters defined above use the following CBOR major types:

          /-----------+--------------+-----------------------\
          | Value     | Major Type   | Key                   |
          |-----------+--------------+-----------------------|
          | 0         | 0            | token                 |
          | 1         | 0            | resource_id           |
          | 2         | 0            | client_id             |
          | 3         | 0            | client_secret         |
          \-----------+--------------+-----------------------/

D.2.2.  Introspection Response

   If the introspection request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server returns a CoAP message with the response encoded
   as a CBOR structure in the payload of the message.  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response using the CoAP 4.00 'Bad Request' response
   code.

   The JSON structure in the payload response includes the top-level
   members defined in Section 2.2 in the OAuth Token Introspection
   specification [I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection].  It is RECOMMENDED to
   only return the 'active' attribute considering constrained nature of
   CoAP client and server networks.

   Introspection responses in CBOR use the following mappings:

   active:

      REQUIRED.  The active key is an indicator of whether or not the
      presented token is currently active.  The specifics of a token's
      "active" state will vary depending on the implementation of the
      authorization server, and the information it keeps about its
      tokens, but a "true" value return for the "active" property will
      generally indicate that a given token has been issued by this
      authorization server, has not been revoked by the resource owner,
      and is within its given time window of validity (e.g., after its
      issuance time and before its expiration time).

   scope:

      OPTIONAL.  A string containing a space-separated list of scopes
      associated with this token, in the format described in Section 3.3
      of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   client_id:

      OPTIONAL.  Client identifier for the client that requested this
      token.

   username:

      OPTIONAL.  Human-readable identifier for the resource owner who
      authorized this token.

   token_type:

      since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token will expire,
      as defined in CWT [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

   iat:

      OPTIONAL.  Integer timestamp, measured in the number of seconds
      since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token will expire,
      as defined in CWT [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

   nbf:

      OPTIONAL.  Integer timestamp, measured in the number of seconds
      since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token will expire,
      as defined in CWT [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

   sub:

      OPTIONAL.  Subject of the token, as defined in CWT
      [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].  Usually a machine-readable
      identifier of the resource owner who authorized this token.

   aud:

      OPTIONAL.  Service-specific string identifier or list of string
      identifiers representing the intended audience for this token, as
      defined in CWT [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

   iss:

      OPTIONAL.  String representing the issuer of this token, as
      defined in CWT [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token].

   cti:

      OPTIONAL.  String identifier for the token, as defined in CWT
      [I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token]

   The parameters defined above use the following CBOR major types:
