<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>Authorization is the process for granting approval to an entity to access a
resource <xref target="RFC4949"/>.  Managing authorization information for a 
large number of devices and users is often a complex task where dedicated 
servers are used.</t>

<t>Managing authorization of users, services and their devices with the help of
dedicated authorization servers (AS) is a common task, found in enterprise
networks as well as on the Web.  In its simplest form the authorization task can
be described as granting access to a requesting client, for a resource hosted on 
a device, the resource server (RS).  This exchange is mediated by one or multiple 
authorization servers.</t>

<t>We envision that end consumers and enterprises will want to manage
access-control and authorization for their Internet of Things (IoT) devices in
the same style and this desire will increase with the number of exposed
services and capabilities provided by applications hosted on the IoT 
devices.  The IoT devices may be constrained in various ways 
including processing, memory, code-size, energy, etc., as defined in
<xref target="RFC7228"/>, and the different IoT deployments present a continuous
range of device and network capabilities.  Taking energy consumption as an
example: At one end there are energy-harvesting or battery powered devices which 
have a tight power budget, on the other end there are devices connected to
a continuous power supply which are not constrained in terms of power, and all 
levels in between.  Thus IoT devices are very different in terms of available 
processing and message exchange capabilities.
</t>

<t>This memo describes how to re-use OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> to
extend authorization to Internet of Things devices with different kinds of
constraints.  It constitutes a framework that describes building blocks
for adapting OAuth 2.0 to an IoT setting.  Detailed, interoperable deployments
of this framework will be described in profiles, which MUST comply with this
profile. Implementations can then claim conformance with a specific profile,
where implementations of the same profile MUST be interoperable while
implementations of different profiles are not expected to be.  Powerful
endpoints may support multiple profiles in order to be able to interact with a
variety of less powerful devices.</t>

  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119"/>.  </t>

  <t>Certain security-related terms such as "authentication",
"authorization", "confidentiality", "(data) integrity", "message
authentication code", and "verify" are taken from <xref

  </t>

  <t>Since we describe exchanges as RESTful protocol interactions HTTP
<xref target="RFC7231"/> offers useful terminology.
  </t>

  <t>Terminology for entities in the architecture is defined in OAuth
2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-actors"/>,
such as client (C), resource server (RS), and authorization server
(AS).  OAuth 2.0 uses the term "endpoint" to denote HTTP resources such as 
/token and /authorize at the AS, but we will use the term "resource" in this 
memo to avoid confusion with the CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> term 
"endpoint".</t>

<t>
Since this memo focuses on the problem of access control to resources, we
simplify the actors by assuming that the client authorization server (CAS)
functionality is not stand-alone but subsumed by either the authorization server
or the client (see section 2.2 in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-actors"/>).
</t>

</section>

<!-- ***************************************************** -->

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">

  <t>This specification describes a framework for authorization in the Internet
      of Things consisting of a set of building blocks.</t>

  <t>
  The basic block is the OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/>
  framework, which enjoys widespread deployment.  Many IoT devices can support
  OAuth 2.0 without any additional extensions, but for certain constrained
  settings additional profiling is needed.
  </t>

  <t>Another building block is the lightweight web transfer protocol CoAP
  <xref target="RFC7252"/> for those communication environments where HTTP is
  not appropriate.  CoAP typically runs on top of UDP which further reduces
  overhead and message exchanges.  Transport layer security can be provided
  either by DTLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC6347"/> or TLS 1.2 
  <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
  </t>

  <t>A third building block is CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> for encodings
  where JSON <xref target="RFC7159"/> is not sufficiently compact.  CBOR is a 
  binary encoding designed for extremely small code size and fairly small
  message size.  OAuth 2.0 allows access tokens to use different encodings and 
  this document defines such an alternative encoding.  The COSE message format 
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/> is also based on CBOR.
  </t>

  <t>A fourth building block is application layer security, which is used
  where transport layer security is insufficient.  At the time of writing
  the preferred approach for securing CoAP at the application layer is via the
  use of COSE <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>, which adds object security to
  CBOR-encoded data.  More details about applying COSE to CoAP can be found in
  OSCOAP <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-object-security"/>.
  </t>

  <t>With the building blocks listed above, solutions satisfying various
  IoT device and network constraints are possible.  A list of constraints is
  described in detail in RFC 7228 <xref target="RFC7228"/> and a description
  of how the building blocks mentioned above relate to the various constraints
  can be found in <xref target="constraints"/>.</t>


  <t>Luckily, not every IoT device suffers from all constraints.  The described
  framework nevertheless takes all these aspects into account and allows 
  several different deployment variants to co-exist rather than mandating a
  one-size-fits-all solution.  We believe this is important to cover the wide
  range of possible interworking use cases and the different requirements from 
  a security point of view.  Once IoT deployments mature, popular deployment
  variants will be documented in form of profiles.</t>

  <t>In the subsections below we provide further details about the different
  building blocks.</t>

  <section anchor="oauth2Overview" title="OAuth 2.0">
    <t>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a client to obtain
    limited access to a resource with the permission of a resource 
    owner.  Authorization related information is passed between the nodes
    using access tokens.  These access tokens are issued to clients by an
    authorization server with the approval of the resource owner.  The client
    uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the
    resource server.</t>

    <t>A number of OAuth 2.0 terms are used within this memo:

    <list style="hanging">

      <t hangText="Access Tokens:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An
        access token is a data structure representing authorization permissions
        issued to the client.  Access tokens are generated by the authorization 
        server and consumed by the resource server.  The access token is opaque 
        to the client.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Access tokens can have different formats, and various methods
        of utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the security
        requirements of the given deployment.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Proof of Possession Tokens:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
        An access token may be bound to a
        cryptographic key, which is then used by an RS to authenticate requests
        from a client.  Such tokens are called proof-of-possession tokens (or
        PoP tokens) <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-architecture"/>.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The proof-of-possession (PoP) security concept assumes that the AS acts
        as a trusted third party that binds keys to access tokens.  These so
        called PoP keys are then used by the client to demonstrate the
        possession of the secret to the RS when accessing the resource.  The
        RS, when receiving an access token, needs to verify that the key used
        by the client matches the one included in the access token.  When this 
        memo uses the term "access token" it is assumed to be a PoP token unless
        specifically stated otherwise.

        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The key bound to the access token (aka PoP key) may be based on
        symmetric as well as on asymmetric cryptography.  The appropriate
        choice of security depends on the constraints of the IoT devices as
        well as on the security requirements of the use case.

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Symmetric PoP key:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
              The AS generates a random symmetric PoP key, encrypts it for the 
              RS and includes it inside an access token.  The PoP key is also
              encrypted for the client and sent together with the access token
              to the client.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Asymmetric PoP key:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
              An asymmetric key pair is generated on the client and the public
              key is sent to the AS (if it does not already have knowledge of
              the client's public key).  Information about the public key,
              which is the PoP key in this case, is then included inside the
              access token and sent back to the requesting client.  The RS
	      can identify the client's public key from the information in the
	      token, which allows the client to use the corresponding private
	      key for the proof of possession.
          </t>
        </list>
        <vspace blankLines="1"/> The access token is
        protected against modifications using a MAC or a digital signature
        of the AS.  The choice of PoP key does not necessarily imply a specific
        credential type for the integrity protection of the token.  More
        information about PoP tokens can be found in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-architecture"/>.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Scopes and Permissions:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
         In OAuth 2.0, the client specifies the type of permissions it is
         seeking to obtain (via the scope parameter) in the access request.  In
         turn, the AS may use the "scope" response parameter to inform the
         client of the scope of the access token issued.  As the client could
	 be a constrained device as well, this memo uses CBOR encoded messages 
         defined in <xref target="app:cborMappingsForOAuth2Properties" /> to 
         request scopes and to be informed what scopes the access token was 
         actually authorized for by the AS.
         <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         The values of the scope parameter are expressed as a list of space-
         delimited, case-sensitive strings, with a semantic that is well-known
	 to the AS and the RS.
         <!-- <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         A common misconception is that the requested scopes must
         also be included in the returned access token, but the requested scopes
         are only metadata about the token.  They could also be packaged in the
         token as a separate attribute, but it's more common to assert the
         requested and authorized access using claims within the access token.
         <vspace blankLines="1"/>-->
         More details about the concept of scopes is found under Section 3.3 in
         <xref target="RFC6749" />.
      </t>


      <t hangText="Claims:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>

        The information carried in the access token in the form of type-value 
        pairs is called claims.  An access token may for example include a claim
        about the AS that issued the token (the "iss" claim) and what audience
        the access token is intended for (the "aud" claim).  The audience of an
        access token can be a specific resource or one or many resource 
        servers.  The resource owner policies influence the what claims are put 
        into the access token by the authorization server.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        While the structure and encoding of the access token varies throughout 
        deployments, a standardized format has been defined with the JSON Web 
        Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> where claims are encoded as a JSON 
        object.  In <xref target="I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token"/> an
	equivalent format using CBOR encoding (CWT) has been defined.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Introspection:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Introspection is a method for a resource server to query the
        authorization server for the active state and content of a received
        access token.  This is particularly useful in those cases where the
        authorization decisions are very dynamic and/or where the received
        access token itself is a reference rather than a self-contained
        token.   More information about introspection in OAuth 2.0 can be
        found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection"/>.

<section anchor="coap" title="CoAP">

    <t>
    CoAP is an application layer protocol similar to HTTP, but specifically
    designed for constrained environments.  CoAP typically uses
    datagram-oriented transport, such as UDP, where reordering and loss
    of packets can occur.  A security solution need to take the latter aspects
    into account.</t>

    <t>While HTTP uses headers and query-strings to convey additional
    information about a request, CoAP encodes such information in so-called
    'options'.</t>

    <t>CoAP supports application-layer fragmentation of the CoAP payloads
    through blockwise transfers <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-block"/>.  However,
    this method does not allow the fragmentation of large CoAP options,
    therefore data encoded in options has to be kept small.
   <!-- Note that the use of block transfers prevents
        end-to-end security since
    some operations by proxies requires access to meta-data. --> </t>

</section>

<section anchor="objectsecurity" title="Object Security">

  <t>Transport layer security is not always sufficient and application layer
  security has to be provided.  COSE <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/> defines
  a message format for cryptographic protection of data using CBOR encoding.
  There are two main approaches for application layer security:

    OSCOAP <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-object-security"/> is a method for
    protecting CoAP request/response message exchanges, including CoAP
    payloads, CoAP header fields as well as CoAP options.  OSCOAP provides
    end-to-end confidentiality, integrity and replay protection, and a secure
    binding between CoAP request and response messages.
    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
    A CoAP message
    protected with OSCOAP contains the CoAP option "Object-Security"
    which signals that the CoAP message carries a COSE message
    (<xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>).  OSCOAP defines a profile of COSE
    which includes replay protection.</t>

    <t hangText="Object Security of Content (OSCON)"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
    For the case of wrapping of application layer payload data ("content")
    only, such as resource representations or claims of access tokens,
    the same COSE profile can be applied to obtain end-to-end
    confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.
    <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-object-security"/> defines this functionality
    as Object Security of Content (OSCON).
    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
    In this case, the message is not
    bound to the underlying application layer protocol and can therefore be used
    with HTTP, CoAP, Bluetooth Smart, etc.  While OSCOAP integrity protects
    specific CoAP message meta-data like request/response code, and binds a
    response to a specific request, OSCON protects only payload/content,
    therefore those security features are lost.  The advantages are that an 
    OSCON message can be passed across different protocols, from request to 
    response, and used to secure group communications.
   <!-- <vspace blankLines="1"/>

<section anchor="specs" title="Protocol Interactions">

<t>
    This framework is based on the same protocol interactions as OAuth 2.0:
    A client obtains an access token from an AS and presents the token
    to an RS to gain access to a protected resource.  These interactions are
    shown in <xref target="fig:protocolFlow"/>.  An overview of various OAuth 
    concepts is provided in <xref target="oauth2Overview"/>.
</t>

<t>
    The consent of the resource owner, for giving a client access to a protected
    resource, can be pre-configured authorization policies or dynamically at the
    time when the request is sent.  The resource owner and the requesting
    party (= client owner) are not shown in <xref target="fig:protocolFlow"/>.
</t>

<t>
  For the description in this document we assume that the client has been 
  registered to an AS.  Registration means that the two share credentials, 
  configuration parameters and that some form of authorization has taken 
  place.  These credentials are used to protect the token request by the 
  client and the transport of access tokens and client information from AS 
  to the client. </t> 

 <t>It is also assumed that the RS has been registered with the AS.
 Established keying material between the AS and the RS allows the AS to apply
 cryptographic protection to the access token to ensure that the content cannot
 be modified, and if needed, that the content is confidentiality protected.</t> 

<t>The keying material necessary for establishing communication security
  between C and RS is dynamically established as part of the protocol described 
  in this document.
</t>

<t>
    At the start of the protocol there is an optional discovery step where the
    client discovers the resource server and the resources this server hosts.
    In this step the client might also determine what permissions are needed to
    access the protected resource.  The exact procedure depends on the
    protocols being used and the specific deployment environment.  In Bluetooth
    Smart, for example, advertisements are broadcasted by a peripheral,
    including information about the supported services.  In CoAP, as a second
    example, a client can makes a request to "/.well-known/core" to obtain
    information about available resources, which are returned in a
    standardized format as described in <xref target="RFC6690"/>.

  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Requesting an Access Token (A):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The client makes an access token request to the AS.  This memo assumes
      the use of PoP tokens (see <xref target="oauth2Overview"/> for a short
      description) wherein the AS binds a key to an access token.  The client
      may include permissions it seeks to obtain, and information about the
      type of credentials it wants to use (i.e., symmetric or asymmetric
      cryptography).
    </t>

    <t hangText="Access Token Response (B):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      If the AS successfully processes the request from the client, it returns 
      an access token.  It also includes various parameters, which we call 
      "Client Information".  In addition to the response parameters defined by 
      OAuth 2.0 and the PoP token extension, we consider new kinds of response 
      parameters in <xref target="specsClientInfo"/>, including information on 
      which security protocol the client should use with the resource server(s)
      that it has just been authorized to access.  Communication security
      between client and RS may be based on pre-provisioned keys/security
      contexts or dynamically established. The RS authenticates the client via 
      the PoP token; and the client authenticates the RS via the client 
      information as described in
      <xref target="oauth2Profiles"/>.
    </t>

    <t hangText="Resource Request (C):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The client interacts with the RS to request access to the protected
      resource and provides the access token.  The protocol to use
      between the client and the RS is not restricted to CoAP; HTTP, HTTP/2,
      Bluetooth Smart etc., are also possible candidates. 
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Depending on the device limitations and the selected protocol this
      exchange may be split up into two phases: 

<list style="empty">
<t>(1) the client sends the access token
      to a newly defined authorization endpoint at the RS (see <xref target="oauth2ProfilesAuthzInfo"/>)
      , which conveys authorization information to the RS that may be used by the client for
      subsequent resource requests, and </t> 
<t>(2) the client makes the resource access request, using the communication security protocol and other
    client information obtained from the AS.</t>
</list> 

      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The RS verifies that the token is integrity protected by the AS and 
      compares the claims contained in the access token with the resource 
      request.  If the RS is online, validation can be handed over to the AS
      using token introspection (see messages D and E) over HTTP or CoAP, in
      which case the different parts of step C may be interleaved with
      introspection.
    </t>

    <t hangText="Token Introspection Request (D):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      A resource server may be configured to use token introspection to
      interact with the AS to obtain the most recent claims, such as scope,
      audience, validity etc. 
      associated with a specific access token.  Token introspection over
      CoAP is defined in
      <xref target="I-D.wahlstroem-ace-oauth-introspection"/> and for HTTP in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-introspection"/>.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Note that token introspection is an optional step and can be omitted if
      the token is self-contained and the resource server is prepared to
      perform the token validation on its own.
    </t>

    <t hangText="Token Introspection Response (E):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The AS validates the token and returns the claims associated with it
      back to the RS.  The RS then uses the received claims to process the
      request to either accept or to deny it.
    </t>

    <t hangText="Protected Resource (F):"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
      If the request from the client is authorized, the RS fulfills the request 
      and returns a response with the appropriate response code.  The RS uses the
      dynamically established keys to protect the response, according to used
      communication security protocol.

<section anchor="specsClientInfo" title="OAuth 2.0 Profiling">

  <t>
    This section describes profiles of OAuth 2.0 adjusting it to constrained
    environments for use cases where this is necessary.  Profiling for
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is provided in 
    <xref target="I-D.wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token"/>.
  </t>



<section anchor="oauth2Profiles" title="Client Information">
    
    <t>OAuth 2.0 using bearer tokens, as described in <xref
    target="RFC6749"/> and in <xref target="RFC6750"/>, 
    requires TLS for all communication interactions between client, 
    authorization server, and resource server.  This is possible in the scope
    where OAuth 2.0 was originally developed: web and mobile applications.  In
    these environments resources like computational power and bandwidth are
    not scarce and operating systems as well as browser platforms are 
    pre-provisioned with trust anchors that enable clients to authenticate
    servers based on the Web PKI.  In a more heterogeneous IoT environment a 
    wider range of use cases needs to be supported.  Therefore, this document
    suggests extensions to OAuth 2.0 that enables the client to reuqest the use
    of a specific profile from the AS, and in response the AS can inform the
    client which profiles the RS supports.</t>
    
    <t>In the OAuth memo defining the key distribution for
    proof-of-possession (PoP) tokens <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution"/>,  the authors suggest to
    use Uri-query parameters in order to submit the parameters of the client's
    token request.  To avoid large headers if the client uses CoAP to
    communicate with the AS, this memo specifies the following alternative for
    submitting client request parameters to the AS: The client encodes the
    parameters of its request as a CBOR map and submits that map as the
    payload of the client request.  The Content-format MUST be
    application/cbor in that case.</t>
    
    <t>The OAuth memo further specifies that the AS shall use a JSON
    structure in the payload of the response to encode the response
    parameters.  These parameters include the access token, destined
    for the RS and additional information for the client, such as e.g. the PoP
    key.  We call this information "client information".  If the client is
    using CoAP to communicate with the AS the AS SHOULD use CBOR instead of
    JSON for encoding its response.  The client can explicitly request this
    encoding by setting the CoAP Accept option in the access token request to
    "application/cbor".</t>

    <t>If the channel between client and AS is not secure, the whole messages 
    from client to AS and vice-versa MUST be wrapped in JWEs 
    <xref target="RFC7516"/> or COSE_Encrypted structures <xref 
    target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>.  The client can explicitly request COSE
    wrapping by setting the CoAP Accept option to "application/cose".</t>

    <t>The client may be a constrained device and could therefore be limited
    in the encodings and protocols it supports.  It can therefore
    signal to the AS which protocols it can support for securing their 
    mutual communication.  This is done by using the "profile" parameter
    defined below in the Token Request message sent to the AS.</t>

    <t>Note that The OAuth key distribution specification <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution"/> describes in section 6
    how the client can request specific types of keys (symmetric vs. 
    asymmetric) and proof-of-possession algorithms in the PoP token
    request.  These are used as well in this specification.</t>

    <t>The client and the RS might not have any prior knowledge about each 
    other, therefore the AS needs to help them to establish a security context 
    or at least a common key using one of the profiles of this framework.  The
    AS does this by using the "profile" datastructure containing information
    about the communication and communication security protocols, the method of
    token transport, and the supported credentials in the client information.
    Profiles MAY extend the range of information carried in this
    datastructure.</t>

    	therefor register the option Access-Token. The Access-Token option 
    	is an alternative for transferring the access token when it is smaller

    <t>A consequence of allowing the use of CoAP as web transfer protocol
      is that we cannot rely on HTTP specific mechanisms, such as
      transferring information elements in HTTP headers since those are not

      larger than 255 bytes it should not be sent as a CoAP option.

<section anchor="tokenValidity" title="Token Expiration">
    <t>Depending on the capabilities of the RS, there are various ways in

    RS.</t>
    
    <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>The token is a CWT/JWT and includes a 'exp' claim and possibly the
      'nbf' claim.  The RS verifies these by comparing them to values from 
      its internal clock as defined in <xref target="RFC7519"/>.  In this
      case the RS must have a real time chip (RTC) or some other way of 
      reliably measuring time.</t>

      <t>The RS verifies the validity of the token by performing an
      introspection request as specified in <xref
      target="introspectionResource"/>.  This requires the RS to have a
      reliable network connection to the AS and to be able to handle two
      secure sessions in parallel (C to RS and AS to RS).</t>

      <t>The RS and the AS both store a sequence number linked to their common
      security association.  The AS increments this number for each access
      token it issues and includes it in the access token, which is a
      CWT/JWT.  The RS keeps track of the most recently received sequence
      number, and only accepts tokens as valid, that are in a certain range
      around this number.  This method does only require the RS to keep track
      of the sequence number.  The method does not provide timely expiration,
      but it makes sure that older tokens cease to be valid after a specified
      number of newer ones got issued.  For a constrained RS with no network
      connectivity and no means of reliably measuring time, this is the best
      that can be achieved.</t>

    <section title="Design Justification" anchor="constraints">

     <t>This section provides further insight into the design decisions
     of the solution documented in this document.  <xref target="overview"/>
     lists several building blocks and briefly summarizes their importance.
     The justification for offering some of those building blocks, as opposed
     to using OAuth 2.0 as is, is given below.</t>

     <t>Common IoT constraints are:

        <list style="hanging">

          <t hangText="Low Power Radio:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Many IoT devices are equipped with a small battery which needs
          to last for a long time.  For many constrained wireless devices the
          highest energy cost is associated to transmitting or receiving
          messages.  It is therefore important to keep the total communication
          overhead low, including minimizing the number and size of messages
          sent and received, which has an impact of choice on the message format
          and protocol.  By using CoAP over UDP, and CBOR encoded messages
          some of these aspects are addressed.  Security protocols contribute
          to the communication overhead and can in some cases be
          optimized.  For example authentication and key establishment may in
          certain cases where security requirements so allows be replaced by
          provisioning of security context by a trusted third party, using
          transport or application layer security.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Low CPU Speed:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Some IoT devices are equipped with processors that are significantly
          slower than those found in most current devices on the Internet.
          This typically has implications on what timely cryptographic
          operations a device is capable to perform, which in turn impacts
          e.g. protocol latency.  Symmetric key cryptography may be used
          instead of the computationally more expensive public key cryptography
          where the security requirements so allows, but this may also require
          support for trusted third party assisted secret key establishment
          using transport or application layer security.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Small Amount of Memory:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Microcontrollers embedded in IoT devices are often equipped with
          small amount of RAM and flash memory, which places limitations what
          kind of processing can be performed and how much code can be put on
          those devices.  To reduce code size fewer and smaller protocol
          implementations can be put on the firmware of such a device.  In
          this case, CoAP may be used instead of HTTP,  symmetric key
          cryptography instead of public key cryptography, and CBOR instead of
          JSON.  Authentication and key establishment protocol, e.g. the DTLS
          handshake,  in comparison with assisted key establishment also has
          an impact on memory and code.
          </t>

          <t hangText="User Interface Limitations:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Protecting access to resources is both an important security as well
          as privacy feature.  End users and enterprise customers do not want
          to give access to the data collected by their IoT device or to
          functions it may offer to third parties.  Since the classical
          approach of requesting permissions from end users via a rich user
          interface does not work in many IoT deployment scenarios these
          functions need to be delegated to user controlled devices that are
          better suitable for such tasks, such as smart phones and tablets.</t>

          <t hangText="Communication Constraints:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          In certain constrained settings an IoT device may not be able to
          communicate with a given device at all times.  Devices may be
          sleeping, or just disconnected from the Internet because of general
          lack of connectivity in the area, for cost reasons, or for security
          reasons, e.g. to avoid an entry point for Denial-of-Service attacks.

          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          The communication interactions this framework builds upon (as shown
          graphically in <xref target="fig:protocolFlow"/>) may be accomplished
          using a variety of different protocols, and not all parts of the
          message flow are used in all applications due to the communication
          constraints.  While we envision deployments to make use of CoAP we
          explicitly want to support HTTP, HTTP/2 or specific protocols, such
          as Bluetooth Smart communication, which does not necessarily use
          IP.  The latter raises the  need for application layer security over
          the various interfaces.

      <t>
        Many IoT devices can support OAuth 2.0 without any additional
        extensions, but for certain constrained settings additional profiling
        is needed.  In this appendix we define CoAP resources for the HTTP based
        token and introspection endpoints used in vanilla OAuth 2.0.  We also
        define a CBOR alternative to the JSON and form based POST structures

              <t>If the introspection request is valid and authorized, the
              authorization server returns a CoAP message with the response 
              encoded as a CBOR structure in the payload of the message.  If the
              request failed client authentication or is invalid, the
              authorization server returns an error response using the CoAP 4.00 
              'Bad Request' response code.</t>

             <t>The JSON structure in the payload response includes the top-level

                   information it keeps about its tokens, but a "true" value
                   return for the "active" property will generally indicate that

        <t>There is a large variety of IoT deployments, as is indicated in 
        <xref target="constraints"/>, and this section highlights a few common 
        variants.  This section is not normative but illustrates how the
        framework can be applied.
        </t>

        <t>For each of the deployment variants there are a number of possible
        security setups between clients, resource servers and authorization
        servers.  The main focus in the following subsections is on how 
        authorization of a client request for a resource hosted by a RS is 
        performed.  This requires the the security of the requests and 
        responses between the clients and the RS to consider. 
        </t>

        <t>Note: CBOR diagnostic notation is used for examples of requests 
          and responses.</t>

<section anchor="localTokenValidation" title="Local Token Validation">
  <t>In this scenario we consider the case where the resource server is offline, 
i.e. it is not connected to the AS at the time of the access request. 
This access procedure involves steps A, B, C, and F of <xref target="fig:protocolFlow"/>.
  </t>

  <t>Since the resource server must be able to verify the access token locally,
  self-contained access tokens must be used.</t>

    <t>This example shows the interactions between a client, the
    authorization server and a temperature sensor acting as a resource server.  Message
    exchanges A and B are shown in <xref target="fig:RSOffline"/>.</t>

    <t><list style="hanging">
      <t>A: The client first generates a public-private key pair used for
      communication security with the RS.</t>

      <t>The client sends the POST request to /token at the AS.  The request
      contains the public key of the client and the Audience parameter set to
      "tempSensorInLivingRoom", a value that the temperature sensor
      identifies itself with.  The AS evaluates the request and authorizes the
      client to access the resource.</t>

      <t>B: The AS responds with a PoP token and client information.  The PoP
      token contains the public key of the client, and the client information
      contains the public key of the RS.  For communication security
      this example uses DTLS RawPublicKey between the client and the RS. The issued 
      token will have a short validity time, i.e. 'exp' close to 'iat', 
      to protect the RS from replay attacks since it, that cannot 
      do introspection to check the tokens current validity. The token includes the
      claim "aif" with the authorized access that an owner of the
      temperature device can enjoy.  The 'aif' claim, issued by the AS,
      informs the RS that the owner of the token, that can prove
      the possession of a key is authorized to make a GET request
      against the /temperature resource and a POST request on the /firmware
      resource.</t>
 
      <t>Note: In this example we assume that the client knows what resource it
      wants to access, and is therefore able to request specific
      audience and scope claims for the access token.</t>

<section anchor="introspectionAidedTokenValidation" title="Introspection Aided Token Validation">

  <t>In this deployment scenario we assume that a client is not be able to 
  access the AS at the time of the access request.  Since the RS is, however, 
  connected to the back-end infrastructure it can make use of token 
  introspection.  This access procedure involves steps A-F of 
  <xref target="fig:protocolFlow"/>, but assumes steps A and B have been
  carried out during a phase when the client had connectivity to AS.
  </t>

  <t>Since the client is assumed to be offline, at least for a certain period of 
  time, a pre-provisioned access token has to be long-lived.  The resource 
  server may use its online connectivity to validate the access token with the
  authorization server, which is shown in the example below.</t>

    <t>In the example we show the interactions between an offline client
    (key fob), a resource server (online lock), and an authorization server.  We
    assume that there is a provisioning step where the client has access to the
    AS.  This corresponds to message exchanges A and B which are shown in
    <xref target="fig:cOffline"/>.
    </t>
    <t>Authorization consent from the resource owner can be pre-configured, 
    but it can also be provided via an interactive flow with the resource 
    owner.  An example of this for the key fob case could be that the 
    resource owner has a connected car, he buys a generic key that he 
    wants to use with the car.  To authorize the key fob he connects it 
    to his computer that then provides the UI for the device.  After 
    that OAuth 2.0 implicit flow can used to authorize the key for 
    his car at the the car manufacturers AS.</t>

      <t>Note: In this example the client does not know the exact door it 
        will be used to access since the token request is not send at the 
        time of access. So the scope and audience claims is set quite 
        wide to start with and new values different form the 
        original once can be returned from introspection later on.</t>
            <t>
      <list style="hanging">
        <t>A: The client sends the request using POST to /token at AS.  The
        request contains the Audience parameter set to  "PACS1337" (PACS, Physical Access System), a
        value the that the online door in question identifies itself with.  The
        AS generates an access token as on opaque string, which it can match to
        the specific client, a targeted audience and a symmetric key.</t>

        <t>B: The AS responds with the an access token and client information,
        the latter containing a symmetric key.
        Communication security between C and RS will be DTLS and PreSharedKey. 
        The PoP key being used as the PreSharedKey.

    <t>The access token in this case is just an opaque string referencing
   the authorization information at the AS.</t>

    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t>C: Next, the client POSTs the access token to the /authz-info
        resource in the RS.  This is a plain CoAP request, i.e. no 
        DTLS between client and RS.  Since the token is an opaque string,
        the RS cannot verify it on its own, and thus defers to respond the 
        client with a status code until after step E.</t>

        <t>D: The RS forwards the token to the /introspect
        resource on the AS.  Introspection assumes a secure connection
        between the AS and the RS, e.g. using transport of application layer security,  which
  is not detailed in this example.
        </t>

        <t>E: The AS provides the introspection response containing claims
  about the token.  This includes the confirmation key (cnf) claim
        that allows the RS to verify the client's proof of possession in
  step F.</t>

        <t>After receiving message E, the RS responds to the client's POST in
        step C with Code 2.01 Created.</t>
